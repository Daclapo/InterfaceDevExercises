# JavaScript Exercises

Welcome to the **JavaScript Exercises** repository! This collection includes a variety of JavaScript exercises and projects developed as part of the **_Desarrollo de Interfaces_** module from the **Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma** program, taught by **Manuel Retamosa**, along with additional personal projects and exercices. 

These exercises are focused on **web interface development** and aim to enhance understanding of JavaScript for interactive, dynamic web applications.

## Description

The exercises in this repository cover a range of foundational and advanced JavaScript concepts essential for web development. Key topics include:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating dynamic web interfaces and interactive elements.
- **Event Handling**: Capturing and managing user actions on the page.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Using promises, async/await, and handling AJAX requests for responsive interfaces.
- **Web APIs**: Interfacing with APIs to bring data and functionalities into web applications.

Each directory includes exercises or projects designed to build up your JavaScript skills progressively, with a strong focus on building intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
